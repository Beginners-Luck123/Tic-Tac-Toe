# Tic-Tac-Toe
An easy to play game that involves getting the player's mark three in a row in order for them to be declared a winner.
## Description
After asking for player inputs, the program immediately outputs a basic 3 x 3 board with points the users can pick in order to position the character marking they initially choose, ie. 1A, 2B, 3C. Afterwards, player go back in forth in the game in order to get their marking placed consecutively three times in a row, column, or diagonal. Each time a new board pops up showing the chosen positions each turn. If there is no winner, it is decided to be a tie.
